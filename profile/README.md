## Contributing

If you're looking to contribute, check out our [documentation](https://www.wisp.tools/docs) on how to create your first module.

## Deployment

All modules are basic HTML and JS apps that are located in the `wisp-modules` repository. `wisp-web` is the front end interface that you visit on the main website, and it is built on Next.JS. These two repositories are both bundled together on deployment.
